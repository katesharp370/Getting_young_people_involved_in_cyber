# Getting Young People Involved In Cyber

## Introduction
- Introduce myself
- TU '23
- BS in CS and Cyber Sec
- President of TU Women in Cyber Security
- Co-captain of our competitive teams
- But the question remains...

## What can I learn from a college student?
- Currenly living the post secondary education of cyber 
- Witnessing how lack of K-12 cyber exposure impacts incoming college students
- Can see what the future of cyber looks like and what the current issues are

## Employment gap in the industry
- According to the isc2 report: addition of 700,000 professionals to the industry in 2021
- Global gap narrowed from 3.1 million in 2020 to 2.7 million in 2021 (isc2)
- Global demand continues to outpace supply
- There are over 500,000 open positions in the US alone, and only enough professionals to fill 68% of the cyber security jobs demanded (cyberseek)
- This gap has real world consequences
  - Security/system misconfigurations
  - Rushed Deployments
  - Slow Patch Cycles
  - ect.
- With the cybercrime and cyberwar becoming more "mainstream", we need to close the gap 
 
## How do we close this gap?
- Proportionate representation of women
- Currently:
  - 76% of field is male (isc2)
  -  Improvements made since 2013 where only 11% of research participants were women
  -  However women are still outnumbered 3 to 1 
  
## Why arent more women involved?
- As said by Sabna Sainudeen, President of WiCyS India: Part of the challenge with growing ranks of women in cyber is the small number who actually make it to the job
- There is still a stigma for women who want to be a part of IT and security, particularly those who try to pursue a degree in Computer Science and Cyber Security
- I believe the solution to this lies in K-12 education

## K-12 schools lack of cyber education
- As technology has grown, so has technology education in schools
- 45% of school educators surveyd by cyber.org say their students are learning about cyber topics
- Same survey reports that most cyber education focuses around basic digital literacy and cyber bullying
  - great topics, but typically not substantial enough to get people interested in cyber security
- 13% of high school educators say there are cybersecurity competitions available to their students while only 4% for elementary aged children 

## Why aren't more schools teaching cyber?
- Access to resources are inconsistent

## Untapped potential in young children, particularly young girls

## Biases in learning and being interested in technology

## The impact this lack of exposure has on young girls and teens who later try and pursue technology degrees

## How to fix this issue
### Step 1: Get involved in local schools and universities
### Step 2: Start a cyber competition
### Step 3: Mentor young people

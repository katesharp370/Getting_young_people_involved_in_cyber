# Getting Young People Involved In Cyber

## Introduction
- Introduce myself
- TU '23
- BS in CS and Cyber Sec
- President of TU Women in Cyber Security
- Co-captain of our competitive teams
- But the question remains...

## What can I learn from a college student?
- Currenly living the post secondary education of cyber 
- Witnessing how lack of K-12 cyber exposure impacts incoming college students
- Can see what the future of cyber looks like and what the current issues are

## Employment gap in the industry
- According to the isc2 report: addition of 700,000 professionals to the industry in 2021
- Global gap narrowed from 3.1 million in 2020 to 2.7 million in 2021 (isc2)
- Global demand continues to outpace supply
- There are over 500,000 open positions in the US alone, and only enough professionals to fill 68% of the cyber security jobs demanded (cyberseek)
- This gap has real world consequences
  - Security/system misconfigurations
  - Rushed Deployments
  - Slow Patch Cycles
  - ect.
- Russia's cyber war tactics against Ukraine and threats in the US
- With the cybercrime and cyberwar becoming more "mainstream", we need to close the gap 
- As expected, the industry has greatly expanded over the past few years. However, there is still a severe lack of professionals that can fill the growing number of jobs. This presents significant problems with real world consequences. With growing international tensions, action needs to be taken
 
## How do we close this gap?
- Proportionate representation of women
- Currently:
  - 76% of field is male, ~24% female (isc2)
  -  Improvements made since 2013 where only 11% of research participants were women
  -  However women are still outnumbered 3 to 1 
  -  While progress has been made over the past few years, women are still outnumbered 3 to 1 in the industry. Thus, reaching a balanced representation of women in the industry would help close the employment gap. However, this is not a viable solution by simply hiring more women. It is necessary to get more women interested in the field.  
  
## Why arent more women involved?
- As said by Sabna Sainudeen, President of WiCyS India: Part of the challenge with growing ranks of women in cyber is the small number who actually make it to the job
- There is still a stigma for women who want to be a part of IT and security, particularly those who try to pursue a degree in Computer Science and Cyber Security
- I believe the solution to this lies in K-12 education
- The small number of women who make it through college to become cyber security professionals is a large contributor to the lack of women in the field. Not only is it uncommon to see cyber security or computer curriculum in K-12 schools, but children and teens are also still exposed to gender-based stereotypes relating to this profession.

## K-12 schools lack of cyber education
- As technology has grown, so has technology education in schools
- 45% of school educators surveyd by cyber.org say their students are learning about cyber topics
- Same survey reports that most cyber education focuses around basic digital literacy and cyber bullying
  - great topics, but typically not substantial enough to get people interested in cyber security
- 13% of high school educators say there are cybersecurity competitions available to their students while only 9% and 4% for middle and elementary aged children respectively (cyber.org)
- 71% of respondents reported at least a medium interest in cyber sec from their students who participated in extracurriculars and 64% reported at least a medium interest from those who participated in competitions relating to the subject (cyber.org)
- Education drives interest: 
  - Ex: 65% of students who learned about robotics in class were interested in learning more about it; whereas only 35% of students who did not learn about robotics in class wanted to learn more (cyber.org)
  - Briefly discuss my personal experience at Broken Arrow and how the largest high school in the state didn’t begin introducing substantial computer classes until 2017-18 and cyber security until 2021-22 (if BA is this behind, how behind are other schools in our state?) 

## Why aren't more schools teaching cyber?
- Access to resources are inconsistent
- Low
- The lack of cyber security education in schools is due to a multitude of factors. Many schools are in low-income areas that lack adequate funding for such classes. The access to resources is largely inconsistent. Additionally, there is an absence of educators who can teach this subject.    
## Gender biases affecting young girls in pursuing STEM professions 
- From a young age, children are led to believe the stereotype that girls are less interested in STEM than boys. Those stereotypes manifest and girls grow up and decide not to pursue those types of degrees. While recently there have been some headway in encouraging young girls to take an interest in computers, they still do not receive the same social encouragement as boys do to program and play video games (both things that can lead to an interest in cyber security).

## Untapped potential in young children, particularly young girls 
- Young girls need the same level of encouragement that boys receive to pursue programming and other computer-related interests. I can speak personally by saying that I felt woefully underprepared for what I got myself into when pursuing computer science and cyber security. I can also speak for many of my female peers who felt the same way. In my time at university, I’ve run into young women who feel so overwhelmed that they end up dropping the degree and losing interest completely. Many of these incidents can be avoided with more cyber education in K-12. It’s amazing to see what a kindergartener can understand about technology. Recently I was helping at a Girl Scout's cyber security camp and was shocked to find we would be teaching these 5-7-year-olds how to assemble a computer tower. I had my reservations at first. However, I was pleasantly surprised with not only how invested these girls were, but how well they remembered what they were being taught. After showing them the parts, I could go to an assembled tower and point to different things to which these elementary schoolers could tell me what it was and what it did. The interest and eagerness to learn about cyber security is there, it just needs to be nurtured. 

## What can you do to get our youth engaged? 
- Get Involved in local schools and universities – offer to educate teachers on grade-level appropriate cyber security concepts; give a talk at a local university; use your company platform to donate resources or time to the areas that need it most. 
- Host a cyber competition or camp – it's not as hard as you may think to host a competition or camp. Hour of code, CTF’s, and TryHackMe challenges are all easy ways to get children excited about cyber and computers.  
- Mentor young people - mentorships are important for children, teens, and young adults. It gives students a role model to follow and ask questions to.  
- The take away: Invest in students now because they will become the next generation of employees, innovators, and security experts.
